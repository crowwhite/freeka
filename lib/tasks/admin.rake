# TODO: Should create admin in a seed. No need for user input.
# Was asked by akhil sir to do by rake task
#FIXME_AB: Yes I asked it to make a rake and ask user for admin details, so all people installing this app have different admin credentials. Lets do that way.
namespace :admin do
  # TODO: Why TODO??
  # It was generated by scaffold, I don't think I need it. Commenting for now
  # desc "TODO"
  task create: :environment do
    #FIXME_AB: Use Time.current
